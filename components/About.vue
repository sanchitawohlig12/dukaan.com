            Dukaan.com is an idea that was launched nearly 25 years ago. It is
            the world's first "live book & commerce experiment" that covers
            three crucial aspects into one experience:
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            * Swadeshi - Our country is in dire need of promoting goods &
            services that are Made in India. We need to truly reduce our
            reliance on IMPORT and increase EXPORT. At Dukaan.com, we provide a
            full list of 100% Indian products - which keep on becoming part of
            the book. Available across the world.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            * Time - Dukaan.com is an idea that will continue to evolve
            regularly. So, it is not static by futuristic.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            * Ideas - The book will depend on USER PARTICIPATION to create
            content. So, every user of the platform becomes part of the idea
            with real interaction. The user can choose any role - like being a
            buyer, seller, retailer, advertiser, service provider etc.
          </li>
        </ul></v-col

            So, Dukaan.com is not just one thing, it is a DYNAMIC COMBINATION of
            three things:
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>* An evolving book</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            * A platform for receiving goods & services freely that are
            primarily Made in India.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            * An effort to promote trade imbalances and minimise deficits.
